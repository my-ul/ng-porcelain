# Porcelain for Angular 6+

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.2.1.

## Development

The most-productive development environment is to work within the project's Storybook.

First, install the project and run Storybook.

```bash
npm install

npm run storybook
```

Then, navigate to http://localhost:45257. Storybook provides hot-module reloading, so it is not necessary to refresh the page while developing components.

## Build

Run `ng build ngPorcelain` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. The output type is an Angular library, so there is no need to use `--prod`, as the library will be minified by the consuming project.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
