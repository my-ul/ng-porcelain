The checkbox provides an accessible, labeled and styled checkbox functionality that can be used almost exactly like a standard HTML checkbox. The checkbox does not support indeterminate states.

# Inputs

## `[(checked)]: boolean`

Boolean representing whether or not the checkbox is in the checked state. Can be split into `[checked]` and `(checkedChange)`.

## `[(disabled)]: boolean`

Boolean that can be used to disable the checkbox. When disabled, the checkbox will not respond to the user's attempts to change the value. The value can still be changed programatically. Can be split into `[disabled]` and `(disabledChange)`.
